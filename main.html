			<h3>What is Kali?</h3>
			<p>
				Kali is the latest and greatest version of the ever popular Backtrack Linux penetration testing
				distribution. The creators of the Backtrack series kept Kali in a format very similar to Backtrack, so
				anyone familiar with the older Backtrack platform will feel right at home.
				Kali has been re-vamped from the ground up to be the best and most feature rich Ethical Hacking/
				Pentesting distribution available. Kali also runs on more hardware devices greatly increasing your
				options for computer security penetration testing or “pentesting” systems.
				If you are coming to Kali from a Backtrack background, after a short familiarization period you
				should find that everything is very similar and your comfort level should grow very quickly.
				If you are new to Kali, once you get used to it, you will find an easy to use security testing platform
				that includes hundreds of useful and powerful tools to test and help secure your network systems.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Why Use Kali?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Kali includes over 300 security testing tools. A lot of the redundant tools from Backtrack have been
removed and the tool interface streamlined. You can now get to the most used tools quickly as they
appear in a top ten security tool menu. You can also find these same tools and a plethora of others all
neatly categorized in the menu system. 
Kali allows you to use similar tools and techniques that a hacker would use to test the security of your
network so you can find and correct these issues before a real hacker finds them.Hackers usually perform a combination of steps when attacking
a network. These steps are summarized below:
Recon – Checking out the target using multiple sources –
like intelligence gathering.
Scanning – Mapping out and investigating your network.
Exploitation – Attacking holes found during the scanning
process.
Elevation of Privileges – Elevating a lower access
account to Root, or System Level.
Maintaining Access – Using techniques like backdoors to
keep access to your network.
Covering their Tracks – Erasing logs, and manipulating
files to hide the intrusion.
An Ethical Hacker or Penetration Tester (good guys hired to
find the holes before an attacker does) mimics many of these
techniques, using parameters and guidelines set up with
corporate management, to find security issues.
They then report their findings to management and assist in
correcting the issues.
We will not be covering every step in the process, but will
show you many of the techniques that are used, and how to
defend against them.
I would think the biggest drive to use Kali over commercial security solutions is the price. Security
testing tools can be extremely costly, Kali is free! Secondly, Kali includes open source versions of
numerous commercial security products, so you could conceivably replace costly programs by simply
using Kali.
All though Kali does includes several free versions of popular software programs that can be
upgraded to the full featured paid versions and used directly through Kali.
There really are no major tool usage differences between Backtrack and Kali. Kali is basically
Backtrack version 6, or the latest version of Backtrack. But it has been completely retooled from the
ground up, making software updates and additions much easier.
In Backtrack updating some programs seemed to break others, in Kali, you update everything using the
Kali update command which keeps system integrity much better.
Simply update Kali and it will pull down the latest versions of the included tools for you. Just a note
of caution, updating tools individually could break Kali, so running the Kali update is always the best
way to get the latest packages for the OS.
I must admit though, some tools that I liked in the original Backtrack are missing in Kali. It is not too
big of a deal as another tool in Kali most likely does the same or similar thing. And then again you
can install other programs you like if needed.
In addition to stand alone and virtual machine instances of Kali, I also use Kali on a Raspberry Pi - a
mini credit card sized ARM based computer. With Kali, you can do almost everything on a Pi that you
could do on a full sized system. In my book I will cover using the PI as a security testing platform
including testing Wireless networks.
Testing networks with a computer you could fit in your pocket, how cool is that?
Though Kali can’t possibly contain all the possible security tools that every individual would prefer,
it contains enough that Kali could be used from beginning to end. Don’t forget that Kali is not just a
security tool, but a full-fledged Linux Operating System. So if your favorite tool runs under Linux, but
is not included, most likely you can install and run it in Kali.

			<h3>
				Ethical Hacking Issues
			</h3>
			<p>
				Using Ethical Hacking a security tester basically acts like a hacker. He uses tools and techniques that
a hacker would most likely use to test a target network’s security. The difference is, the penetration
tester is hired by the company to test its security and when done reveals to the leadership team how
they got in and what they can do to plug the holes.
The biggest issue I see in using these techniques is ethics and law. Some security testing techniques
that you can perform with Kali and its included tools are actually illegal to do in some areas. So it is
important that users check their local, State and Federal laws before using Kali.
Also, you may have some users that try to use Kali, a very powerful set of tools, on a network that
they do not have permission to do so. Or they will try to use a technique they learned but may have not
mastered on a production network.
All of these are potential legal and ethical issues
			</p>
			<h3>
				Scope of this Book
			</h3>
			<p>
				This book focuses on those with beginning to intermediate experience with Backtrack/ Kali. I think it
would also be a good tool for network administrators and non-security IT professionals that are
looking to get into the field.
We will cover everything from a basic overview of Kali to using the included tools to test security on
Windows and Linux based systems. We will cover Social Engineering, Wi-Fi security, using Kali on
a Raspberry Pi, exploiting passwords, basic computer security testing from reconnaissance to finding
& using exploits, and finally securing your systems
			</p>
			<h3>
				Why did I write this book?
			</h3>
			<p>
				I have written technical articles on Backtrack for several years now, and have helped out with
				multiple Backtrack/ Kali books and training series. I get a lot of questions on how to use Kali/
				Backtrack, so I decided that it was time to write my own beginners guide book.
				My other reason for writing this book is to help get young people interested in the field of computer
				security. The US is currently facing a crisis when it comes to young professionals choosing technical
				careers and the cyber security field is no different.
				The US government is in need of thousands1
				 of cyber warriors and some industry experts have even
				suggested that the US consider hiring security experts2
				 from other countries to fill in the gap.
				Think about that for a minute.
				The numbers game is against us also. The US is the number two user of the internet, with 81% of our
				population connected. Now consider the fact that China is in the number one spot3
				 with almost double
				the amount of users. And their connected rate is only at about 41%!
				Though many think that the US is ranked number one in cyber offense capabilities, our defense is not
				ranked that well. With foreign countries making marked advances in cyber security the US needs to
				get as many brilliant young people into the field as possible, and they need to do it sooner rather than
				later.

				Disclaimer
			</h3>
			<p>
Never try to gain access to or security test a network or computer that you do not have written
permission to do so. Doing so could leave you facing legal prosecution and you could end up in jail.
The information in this book is for educational purposes only.
There are many issues and technologies that you would run into in a live environment that are not
covered. This book only demonstrates some of the most basic tool usage in Kali and should not be
considered as an all-inclusive manual to Ethical hacking or pentesting.
I did not create any of the tools in Kali nor am I a representative of Kali Linux or Offensive Security.
Any errors, mistakes, or tutorial goofs in this book are solely mine and should not reflect on the tool
creators, please let me know where I screwed up so it can be corrected. 
Though not mentioned by name, thank you to the Kali developers for creating a spectacular product
and thanks to the individual tool creators, you are all doing an amazing job and are helping secure
systems worldwide!

			<h2>Part 1: Installing and Basic Overview</h2>
			<h3>
				Introduction
			</h3>
			<p>
In this section we will setup Kali Linux, Windows 7 and Metasploitable 2 as Virtual Machines
(VMs) using VMWare Player on a host computer.
Setting up our testing lab using virtual machines makes it very easy to learn offensive computer
security testing using Kali.
Virtual machines make it possible to run several operating systems on a single computer. That way
we do not need a room full of computers to set up a testing and learning environment. We only need
one machine powerful enough to run several Virtual Machine sessions at once.
For the book I used a Windows 7 Core I-5 system with 8 GB of RAM. It had plenty of power to run
all three of our lab operating systems at the same time with no problem at all.
If you have experience with Virtual Systems, you can use any Virtual Machine software that you want.
But for this tutorial I will be using VMWare Player as the host software, and then install Kali,
Metasploitable 2 and Windows 7 in separate VMs running under the host.
When done, you should have a small test network that looks something like this:

				Description
			</h3>
			<p>
Kali Linux is one of the many programs out there that helps us in the
constant fight—it could even be called a war—with malicious hackers. To
fully use all the advantages it offers, we could spend years in training and
development, but with a little research, anyone can learn just the basics of
cybersecurity. The first step is always smart clicking, updating software,
and staying educated on security awareness. Once you are fully aware of
how essential cyber-security is, you can start making your personal and
company data less accessible to one of the many scams, viruses, and
dangers in the internet world. 
Understanding VPNs, malware, and firewalls can drastically improve the
chances of your business surviving in the ever-changing online world.
Today, cybersecurity causes trillions of dollars in revenue loss, and
preventing malicious attacks could mean the difference between your
company becoming one of the sad statistics or overcoming, adapting, and
rising stronger after being hacked.

			<h3>
				Introduction
			</h3>
			<p>
Kali Linux is a very advanced flavor of Linux, which is used for Security
Auditing and Penetration Testing. After all the tools that we have looked at,
it is pretty clear that if you want to succeed in the domain of Security
Research, Kali Linux will provide with unlimited power to achieve the
same. It is also clear that if you are just beginning with Linux, Kali Linux is
not the place that you would want to start with as it is a highly complex
operating system created and aimed at achieving one goal and that is
security.  
This book discusses the different "hats" of hacking - the black, the white,
and the grey. The black hat is the stereotypical idea of how most in society
conceive hackers to be - the one who wants unauthorized access to the
property or information of another. The white hat is the "good guy" - the
one learning the tricks of the trade in order to prevent the exploitation of
assets or track down offenders. The grey hat is a bit of a hybrid, they use
their hacking skills (although without the prior knowledge or authorization
of the owners) to expose weaknesses in systems so that those systems can
be strengthened. Regardless of the motivations of any individuals, the
knowledge base and general toolkit remain the same. Hacking requires an
understanding of how computing equipment communicates on various
levels, what vulnerabilities lie in both machines and networks, and how
those vulnerabilities are exploited. This knowledge takes time, practice,
study, and discipline to attain, and it is not something that everyday people
are familiar with. As a result, skilled hackers have the ability to either inflict
or prevent quite a bit of damage on individuals, organizations, and society. 
Each hacker should thus adopt some code of ethics to guide them. Even
black hats will have some line that they will not cross in carrying out their
attacks. Law enforcement is becoming very serious about information
security and preventing pervasive attacks on individual identities, on
commerce, and on government institutions. Laws and enforcement vary by
location, but any hacker - black, white, or grey - should have a full
understanding of the risks they are taking. This is especially true of
beginning hackers who don't have the experience to either hide their tracks
or to prevent collateral damage. An attack that is conducted improperly
could erase or corrupt information, or cause other unintended consequences.
That is why it is important to practice skills on one's on systems in an
isolated "sandbox" until gaining enough confidence to attack another
system.  
Maintaining the Hacker’s Edge 
There is a perpetual race going on between the hacker community and the
information security community. When vulnerability is discovered, it tends
to spread wisely and rapidly as evidenced by the WPA Krack attack
described in Chapter X. Security personnel try to keep up by constantly
making patches or upgrades to protect systems. Hackers must constantly
hone their craft and push limits in order to maintain an edge. Like any skill,
hacker skills dwindle if not in regular use. Furthermore, the landscape in
computer security is in constant flux. The open source nature of most
hacking tools means that there are frequent changes in functionality and
syntax that must be kept up with. Vulnerabilities are published and patched
on a near daily basis, and encryption standards are being pushed very hard
to provide better security against attacks. So to maintain an edge and to
have a reasonable chance of becoming a successful hacker, one should do
the following: 
1. Maintain current versions of all operating systems, scripts, tools, and
programming environments 
2. Practice skills on a regular basis, on a sandboxed environment, with
emphasis on improving both speed and anonymity 
3. Periodically probe their own system and adopt the appropriate security
measures 
4. Have a daily or weekly reading cycle on both offensive and defensive
security developments (magazines, journals, web articles, message boards,
dark web hacker communities, etc.)

				Chapter 1 Hacking Basics
			</h3>
			<p>
Now that you are a bit more familiar with ethical hacking and the
importance of cyberlaw, we can continue to discuss the basics that you are
required to understand in order to build a solid foundation.
In this chapter we will focus on the terminology used by cyber-security
specialists and hackers, because you will encounter them frequently within
this book, and communication is key to a successful project. Once you are
familiar with the professional terminology, we will move on to a more
detailed discussion about penetration testing and the methodology behind
writing reports.
			</p>
			<h3>

			</h3>
			<p>
				In this section, we will explore briefly the most important and frequently
encountered terms in the cyber-security sector. You will also find this list of
terms handy as you progress through the chapters.
1. Asset : Assets refer to any devices or components that are
used in any activities that involve the handling of data and
information. An asset needs to be secured from unauthorized
access in order to protect it from unwanted data manipulation.
2. Exploit : This can be a program, a bug, or even a command
used by attackers to find access to the data or information they
seek within the system. An exploit can be anything that takes
advantage of a specific vulnerability within an application or
operating system. It will cause an unanticipated behavior to
the asset, and this will create a gap that can be used by the
hacker to their advantage.
3. Pre-engagement :. Pre-engagement refers to the phase of
preparation where you establish the rules of engagement.
4. Milestone : Being organized is a crucial aspect of being a
professional ethical hacker. This is where milestones come in.
They are used to split the process into stages that are clearly
detailed and assigned to a beginning and an end date. You can
use charts, spreadsheets and various scheduling websites in
order to keep track of your milestones and make sure to
deliver on time.
5. Bot : This is a type of program that is used to automate a
certain action. Humans can only work so fast, but bots can
take care of repetitive tasks much faster and for as long as
needed.
6. Brute force attack : This kind of attack is the simplest, most
common type and it doesn’t involve smashing computers to
bits as the name might suggest. A brute force attack is in fact
an automated method of combining usernames with
passwords until the correct combination is found. The entire
process is automatic, but it can take a lot of time due to a high
number of possible combinations.
7. Denial of Service attack : Also known as a DoS attack, this
is one of the most commonly encountered attacks used by
many beginner black hat hackers. This attack comes as a form
of interruption to the server or network service provided to
various users. It’s a malicious method of denying users
connection to an online service. For instance, if you are
playing an online game, a DoS attack against the game servers
will cause a mass disconnection to all users.
8. Keystroke logging : This is a common way of recording the
keyboard keys and mouse buttons that are pressed on a
computer. The information is used to reveal usernames,
passwords, and other sensitive information. Unlike a brute
force attack, this method is much quicker when it comes to
finding out logging information. For it to work, a keylogger is
injected onto the computer either through an email with a
Trojan containing link or even directly through a USB stick.
9. Malware : This refers to all malicious programs that are
used in hostile actions against a computer or specific
software. Malware comes in the form of Trojans, worms,
adware, spyware, ransomware, and other computer viruses.
10.                     Phishing : This is a type of email fraud. The
intention is to send a seemingly legitimate email with the purpose of
gaining private information from the recipient.
11.                     Rootkit : This is software that operates stealthily
without the knowledge of the targeted user. Its purpose is to hide
various processes that are running in the background in order to
maintain access to the computer. It is mostly used to maintain a
back door to someone’s device while also hiding it from the
authorized user.
12.                     SQL Injection : Another common method used
by black hat hackers to obtain data. This method involves the
injection of SQL code to any data driven software or application.
For example, this can be a statement which tells the application to
send all of its data to the attacker.
There are many other terms that you will discover as you learn more about
hacking. But for now, this terminology is enough for you to gain a glimpse
of what you will be dealing with.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Penetration Testing
			</h3>
			<p>
This process cannot be avoided, because it is the only way to truly discover
exploitable gaps within a system, and therefore you need to familiarize
yourself with each step that you need to take. Keep in mind, however, that
your motivation for the testing is driven by the client and the specific goals
he or she wants to achieve.
Before you begin, you first need to establish the rules of engagement. You
need to set a schedule, discuss each stage of the testing as well as the
methodology, and establish the legal responsibilities. Clearly defining the
penetration test will smoothen the process, keep the client informed, and
protect you from any liabilities. Everything needs to be agreed upon by both
parties involved, so let’s take a look at how this process might look.
Rules of Engagement
1. Before anything else, the hacker and their client need to
sign a nondisclosure agreement as well as permission for
hacking. As a cyber-security specialist, you want to be legally
protected from any kind of liability, so never start doing
anything before the necessary documents are clear to both
sides and signed.
2. The next step is discussing the precise purpose of the
penetration test, as well as what needs to be tested. Sometimes
you will need to test only a certain sector of an organization,
and you also need to know what kind of result is expected
from you.
3. Once you establish the goals and the testing duration, you
should discuss the methodology you will use to perform the
test. There should also be a mention of any techniques the
client doesn’t want to be used. For instance, some
organizations or business do not want the hacker to simulate a
denial of service attack. This needs to be specified when
establishing the rules, otherwise it can lead to confusion,
delays, and even legal problems.
4. The final rule of engagement which is as important as all
the rest is deciding on the liabilities and responsibilities of
both parties. As an ethical hacker, you might access some
sensitive information such as company trade secrets, bank
account details, or you might cause a denial of service.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Penetration Testing in Steps

			</h3>
			<p>
Once the rules of engagement are well established and agreed to by
everyone involved, it’s time to perform the test itself. There are various
testing methodologies and categories, but for now you should learn the
basic stages of penetration testing. Knowing the steps and working through
them one at a time will make your job much easier, so let’s see how a basic
penetration test looks.
1. Passive Scanning : In this phase, you are supposed to
gather information about your target without actually
interacting with it directly. Passive scanning is performed by
going through social networking websites, online databases,
and even by searching for relevant data on a search engine
like Google.
2. Active Scanning : The next step is to probe the target with
the use of specialized tools that are designed for network
mapping, sniffing traffic, banner grabbing and more.
3. Fingerprinting : This does not refer to actual physical
fingerprinting. At this stage, the penetration tester needs to
identify the target’s operating system and version level, all
applications and their patch level, any open ports, active user
accounts and services.
4. Target Identification : In this phase, once the tester has
obtained all the relevant information about the system, the
most useful or vulnerable target is chosen.
5. Vulnerability Exploiting : This is basically the attack itself.
Specialized attack tools are used against the most vulnerable
targets within the system. Some of them will succeed, while
some of them will only kill the server or simply not work at
all.
6. Privilege Escalation : The tester needs to gain more
control, as if they are the authorized user. The purpose of this
stage is to gain administrative access to the system, whether
it’s local or remote.
7. Reporting : This is the final step of the penetration test. The
ethical hacker needs to document and report every aspect of
the test. This includes the tools used, exploited vulnerabilities,
and everything that was found as well as how it was found.
There are other aspects to a penetration test, but for now we will stick to the
basics, as the purpose of this chapter is to familiarize you with the world of
hacking and penetration testing.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Penetration Testing by an Unethical Hacker

			</h3>
			<p>
For this reason, we will take a look at a penetration test from the black hat’s
perspective and see how it differs from the basic ethical test.
1. Choosing a Target : The unethical hacker chooses the target
out of a grudge, for profit, or simply for fun. There are no
rules and regulations involved. Everything is done for
personal reasons.
2. The Intermediary : The attack itself is never directly done
from the hacker’s own system. An intermediary system is
used so that the attack cannot be traced back to the attacker.
The intermediary is often a victim that is used remotely to
gain access to the target’s system.
3. Basic Test Phases :. Even the tools and procedures will be
the same as those used by a cyber-security specialist.
4. Maintaining Access : It is common for hackers to create a
back door on their victim’s system in case they might want
quick access in the future. This is done by installing rootkits
or leaving bots behind to maintain the access.
How the unethical hacker uses the system depends entirely on their
intentions. Some aim to acquire personal information, while others attempt
to extort companies with flaws in their security. The only thing that really
separates the unethical hacker from the ethical one is the goal. The steps
and tools they use to achieve that goal are usually the same.
Penetration Testing Methodologies
Once the rules of engagement are clearly defined, it’s time to consider the
methodology. There is no universal kind of test that can fit every company
or organization. Everyone has their own set of security goals, and there are
many questions that need answering before choosing the correct
methodology. There are a few different kinds of penetration testing
methodologies, and each one of them dictates how a test should be
performed. Here’s a brief explanation of the most common methodologies:
1. OSSTMM : This stands for “Open Source Security Testing
Methodology Manual,” and it is a standardized methodology
for penetration testing. The idea behind it is to guarantee a
baseline for the testing no matter which security specialist or
company performs it. This methodology mandates which
parts of a network to test, how to perform the test, and how to
analyze the resulting data. Penetration tests following the
OSSTMM methodology are thorough, but cumbersome
because they include nearly all the steps of a penetration test.
This means that such a test cannot be performed on a daily
basis without requiring an adequate amount of human
resources and a budget to match.
2. OWASP : This stands for “Open Web Application Security
Project,” and as the name suggests, it is an open source,
community driven methodology aimed at testing web
applications specifically. The purpose of this methodology is
to provide unbiased data that is not influenced by any
commercial or governmental entity. While OSSTMM is more
focused on network security, OWASP focuses on improving
the security of web applications as well as services. For this
methodology, there are various tools developed that software
developers, security analysts, and businesses alike can use in
order to boost their defenses.
3. CHECK : This penetration test methodology was born out
of the need to create secure governmental networks.
Governments handle extremely sensitive information that is
often classified, therefore a high level of consistent testing is
required to guarantee security. The CHECK methodology
focuses mainly on protecting the data stored on a specific
server. The penetration tests performed under it are used to
determine how secure the data is, and in what way could it be
compromised when under attack.
4. NIST : This is a comprehensive penetration testing
methodology that, unlike OSSTMM, can be applied regularly
and in short intervals. There are four main steps to NIST,
which are planning, discovery, attacking, and reporting. The
discovery phased is then broken down into two segments. One
involves basic information gathering, network scans, and
service detection, and the other is all about the vulnerability
assessment. The third stage is the attack, which is the main
step in the test. The purpose is to try and compromise the
targeted device. The reporting phase comes after discovery, as
well as attack.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Penetration Test Categories

			</h3>
			<p>
Depending on what a company or organization wants to test, there are three
penetration test categories, namely White Box, Black Box, and Gray Box.
1. White Box : When all the relevant data on the target is
already provided, the penetration test is considered white box.
If we’re dealing with a network test, the data includes
information on applications and their versions, as well as the
operating system. In the case of a web application, the tester
will receive the source code in order to perform a full
analysis. This type of testing with so much information given
upfront is usually performed only onsite.
2. Black Box : As you might’ve figured it out on your own,
this is the opposite of a white box penetration test. There is no
information offered upfront regarding the operating system or
applications when it comes to network testing. Only IP ranges
are provided so that testing can be performed. The source
code for web application testing is not given either. Black box
penetration testing is usually performed externally, and that is
why most information is kept away. 3. Gray Box : This penetration test category is somewhere in￾between white and black box testing. Some data is provided,
while some is kept away from the tester. For example, for web
applications the source code is not provided, however,
information on the databases, back end server or test accounts
is usually given.
Writing Reports
A successful penetration test is not complete without a good report.
Knowing how to write one, format it, and present it to your audience is the
key to being a skilled ethical hacker. A report should be well-organized,
clear, to the point, and understandable. The format and the way you present
it matters as well. For instance, if you have a red header, all of them should
be red. Consistency and readability are crucial, so when you write your
report take great care. Follow the usual rules of writing and avoid grammar
mistakes while maintaining your voice, or style, throughout the text.
You might consider these tips to be trivialities that are beneath a hacker,
however, well-formatted and written reports enhance your credibility as a
professional.

			<h3>
				Think of Your Audience
			</h3>
			<p>
When writing your report, you should draft it with your audience in mind.
There are three main audience categories, namely the executive class,
management class, and technical class. You need to keep in mind which
part of your report will be the focus of each audience and write it for them.
For instance, a manager will not care about what exploit you used to take
control of a system, however, the company’s tech division will be highly
interested. So let’s briefly discuss each audience in order to understand
what they’re interested in.
1. The executive audience : This audience includes mostly the
CEOs of a company. They will only focus on reading the
executive summary of the report, as well as the remediation
report and perhaps the findings summary. Take note that
usually the executives do not have much technical knowledge
and therefore ignore most of your report. Therefore, you
should write your summaries with this audience in mind.
2. The management audience : This audience will be
interested in your vulnerability assessment and weaknesses
you uncovered. They are the ones handling the security policy
of a company or organization, so they will be interested in a
few more details than CEOs.
3. The technical audience : The software developers as well as
the manager of security will be interested in reading the
details of your report. They are responsible for fixing security
breaches and patching up vulnerabilities, so they will want to
read the technical side of your report thoroughly. You should
include screenshots for them in the report in order to help
them resolve the problems.
Report Structure
Now let’s take a look at the precise structure of a penetration test report to
understand what kind of information it should contain.
1. Cover page : We start from the very beginning with the
cover page. This section should contain your company logo if
you have one, a title, and a short description of the test. The
cover page should look professional, because its quality will
have an impact on how the customer perceives you as a
professional.
2. Table of contents : This section is quite self-explanatory.
Right after the cover page, you should write a clear index so
that each particular audience can skip to the part of the report
that is relevant to their position.
3. The executive summary : This part of the report is
extremely valuable, and it can make or break the entire
documentation. The executive summary is specifically written
for the CEOs of a company or anyone else who holds
executive power. It should be written comprehensively for an
audience that lacks technical knowledge. You should start by
defining the purpose of the test and how you carried it out.
Then explain your results and findings clearly and to the
point. The summary should include the general weaknesses
that were discovered and what exactly caused these
vulnerabilities. Lastly, write about the risks you determined
after your thorough analysis and discuss how you can lower
these risks by applying the right countermeasures.
4. The remediation report : This part of your test report is
mainly aimed towards the management, however the
executive class might also be interested in it. Keep in mind
that both audiences might lack technical knowledge. So
what’s the remediation report all about? It should contain all
your recommendations that will improve security once they
are implemented. For instance, you might suggest
implementing a new firewall or an intrusion detection system.
You should list and describe everything clearly and to the
point.
5. The findings summary : Also known as the vulnerability
assessment summary. In this section of your report you will
discuss all your findings, or in other words the strengths,
weaknesses, and risks involving the system you tested. Here,
you should include charts and other visual representations to
help the audience understand the situation. Display the
vulnerabilities you uncovered and classify them based on how
severe they are.
6. Risk assessment : This is the section where you demonstrate
the risks based on your findings. You should describe the
impact each vulnerability can have on the system and how
often it can occur. 7. Methodology : Keep in mind that this section of the report
is entirely optional, unless you were requested by the client to
follow a specific methodology. In that case, you should report
the steps you took and even include a flowchart that clearly
shows the process.
8. Detailed findings : This part of the report is for the
technical audience. Here you will discuss your findings in
detail and include information on the vulnerabilities you
uncovered, what caused them, what risks are involved and
what your recommendations are to improve data security. The
developers as well as the security manager need to know
where the vulnerability was produced and how in order to
take the right steps to resolve the issue.
Now that you grasp the concept of penetration testing and you understand
how a report is supposed to be written, it’s time to push forward and learn
the technical side of hacking.

			<h2>Chapter 2 Getting Started</h2>
			<h3>

			</h3>
			<p>
				Hackers have a reputation for being highly intelligent individuals and
prodigious in many ways. It can therefore seem to be an overwhelming and
uphill task to start from scratch and reach any level of practical proficiency.
One must remember that everyone must start somewhere when learning a
subject or skill. With dedication and perseverance, it is possible to go as far
in the world of hacking as your will can take you. One thing that will help
in the process of becoming a hacker is to set some goals. Ask yourself why
you want to learn hacking and what you intend to accomplish. Some just
want to learn the basics so they can understand how to protect themselves,
their family, or their business from malicious attacks. Others are looking to
set themselves up for a career in white-hat hacking or information security.
Whatever your reasons, you should prepare to learn quite a bit of new
knowledge and skills.
			</p>
			<h3>

			</h3>
			<p>
				The most important weapon in a hacker’s arsenal is knowledge. Not only is
it important for a hacker to learn as much as possible about computers,
networks, and software - but in order to stay competitive and effective they
must stay up to date on the constant and rapid changes in computers and
computer security. It is not necessary for a hacker to be an engineer,
computer scientist, or to have intimate knowledge of microprocessor or
computer hardware design, but they should understand how a computer
works, the chief components and how they interact, how computers are
networked both locally and through the internet, how users typically
interact with their machines, and - most importantly - how software dictates
computer function. An excellent hacker is fluent and practiced in several
computer languages and understands the major operating systems. In is also
very useful for a hacker to be familiar with the history, mathematics, and
practice of cryptography.
It is possible, and increasingly common, for a layperson with little hacking
experience and only slight or intermediate knowledge about programming
to conduct an attack against a system. People often do this using scripts and
following procedures that were developed by more experienced operators.
This happens most commonly with simpler types of attacks, like denial of
service. These inexperienced hackers are known in the hacking community
as script kiddies. The problem with this type of activity is that the
perpetrators have little appreciation for what’s going on in the code they are
running, and may not be able to anticipate side effects or other unintended
consequences. It is best to fully understand what you are doing before
attempting an attack.
			</p>
			<h3>

			</h3>
			<p>
				Computers vary in size, shape, and purpose, but most of them essentially
				have the same design. A good hacker should study how computers evolved
				from the earliest machines in the 20th century to the vastly more
				sophisticated machines that we use today. In the process, it becomes evident
				that computers have the same basic components. To be an effective hacker,
				you should know the different types of processors that exist on the majority
				of modern computers. For instance, the three largest microprocessor
				manufacturers are Intel, American Micro Devices (AMD), and Motorola.
				These processors comprise most of the personal computers that a hacker
				will encounter, but each has their own unique instruction set. Although
				most hackers rarely have to deal with programming languages on the
				machine level, more sophisticated attacks may require an understanding of
				the differences between processor instruction sets.
				Some processors are programmable by the end user. These are known as
				Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and are being used more and
				more often for embedded systems, particularly in industrial controls.
				Hackers have been known to gain access to these chips while they are in
				production in order to deploy malicious software at the final destination. An
				understanding of FPGA architecture and programming is necessary for
				these types of sophisticated attacks. These embedded attacks are
				particularly concerning to military and industrial customers that purchase
				chips on a large scale for critical systems.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Networks also have different architectures. The architecture is determined
				not only by the configuration of the different nodes but also on the medium
				that connects them. Originally, networked computers were always
				connected by copper wire. Commonly used copper network cables, often
				known as ethernet cables, consist of twisted pairs of copper wire. Although
				the most common of these cables is the category five, or CAT-5, cable, it is
				beginning to give way to a new standard, CAT-6, which has a greater
				capacity for transmission of signals. For very high speed applications and
				longer distances, fiber-optic cables are usually chosen. Fiber optics use light
				instead of electricity and have a very high capacity for carrying
				information. They are used to carry most modern cable television and high
				speed internet services. Fiber optics serve as the backbone for the internet.
				Within smaller areas, wireless networks are very common. Using a Wireless
				Fidelity (Wi-Fi) protocol, wireless networks exist in a large number of
				personal, private, and commercial LANs. Hackers are often particularly
				interested in hacking into Wi-Fi networks, resulting in the evolution of WiFi security standards.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Regardless of the architecture or medium of transmission, when two
				terminals are communicating across a network they must do so using a
				common set of rules known as a protocol. Networking protocols have
				evolved since the first computer networks were created, but they have
				retained the same basic layered approach. In general, a network is
				conceptualized in terms of different layers that perform different functions.
				This is also known as a stack. The most common communication protocols
				used today are the Internet Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol
				(TCP). Taken together, these are commonly known as TCP/IP. These
				protocols change and are standardized on occasion. It is critical for the
				hacker to learn these protocols and how they relate to communication
				between the different layers of the stack. This is how hackers can gain
				higher and higher levels of access to a system.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Programming Languages
				It may seem daunting to learn a programming language from scratch having
				never done it before, but many people find that once they become proficient
				at one programming language, it is much easier and faster to learn others.
				Hackers not only have to understand programming languages to be able to
				exploit software vulnerabilities, but many hackers need to write their own
				code to be able to execute a particular attack. Reading, understanding, and
				writing code is fundamental to hacking.
				Programming languages range from very obscure machine code, which is in
				binary and hexadecimal format and is used to communicate directly with a
				processor, to high-level object-oriented languages that are used for software
				development. Common high-level object-oriented languages are C++ and
				Java. The code written in high-level languages is compiled into the
				appropriate machine code for a particular processor, which makes highlevel languages very portable between different types of machines. Another
				category is a scripted language, where commands are executed line-by-line
				instead of being compiled into machine code.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Learning programming languages takes time and practice - there is no other
				way to become proficient. Long evenings and overnight marathons of
				writing, debugging, and recompiling code are a common rite-of-passage
				among beginning hackers.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Chapter 3 Obtaining Passwords
			</h2>
			<p>
				In this section, we will look at how to obtain the passwords of a network. I
				will focus on wireless networks since for wired networks you will have to
				be connected via a cable. I will be using a Wi-Fi network I created for my
				demonstration.
				There are many ways of obtaining a network password that doesn’t involve
				computer hacking and I recommend you test these methods first and use
				hacking as a last resort. You can do stuff like, looking at files thrown away
				by the organization or person you want to hack or just ask some dude who
				works or stays in the place you want to hack what the password is. Some
				organizations leave it as notes on the wall or write it somewhere everyone
				can see.
				There are many ways you can get a Wi-Fi password using Kali Linux but
				almost all of these processes are time-consuming if the password is long
				and sometimes it fails to crack the password if it is complex. What I am
				going to show you is how to use social engineering to get the password.
				What is social engineering? This is basically a form of hacking in which
				you trick the computer user into doing what you want. Examples of social
				engineering are the phone and email scammers who trick you into giving
				away your credit card details or downloading a virus.
				So we are basically going to trick a computer user to give us their password
				but to do so, we need to look legit. That’s where Fluxion comes into play
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Fluxion is a script that you can install on Kali Linux. It uses social
				engineering to create a Wi-Fi network that is a mirror to that of the target. It
				then disconnects the target from his real Wi-Fi network. Since our fake WiFi looks just like the real one, the user will attempt to reconnect using our
				fake network from which we use a web interface to ask him/her for the
				password.
				After obtaining the password, Fluxion will display it and we can use it to
				connect to the network. The reason fluxion works is because it creates a
				similar Wi-Fi network to that of the target and also has a web interface
				similar to that of different routers. Fluxion also allows you to select your
				language of choice for the attack.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Installing fluxion
				Fluxion is not installed by default in Kali Linux and so we have to install it
				ourselves. You can find the Github repository for Fluxion here . Once on the
				Github repo, click on the “Clone or download” button and then copy the
				link given.
				Open the terminal and navigate to the /opt/ directory by typing cd /opt/ this
				is the directory in which we will install our scripts. If you ever want to go
				back to the home directory you can just type cd and that will do it.
				Once in the /opt/ directory, we now enter the git clone command together
				with the copied link. You can do to by typing git clone and then rightclicking on the terminal and selecting paste to paste the link. You can then
				press enter to start downloading the script; fluxion will begin to download
				as shown in the following image.
				Once the process is complete you can type ls to list all the files in the
				directory. You should see the fluxion folder next to another one called Teeth
				which is usually there by default.
				Now navigate to the fluxion directory by typing cd fluxion , by now you
				should be getting the hang of it. Now use the list command to see the
				various files (white) and folders (blue).
				You will see two files that are green in color, these are the scripts. The one
				that ends in .py is a python script while the one that ends in .sh is a bash
				script. When the scripts are green it means they have the needed
				permissions to run properly. If you find a script that doesn’t have
				permissions (they are white just like other files), use the command chmod
				+x  to grant permissions.
				We are going to run the fluxion.sh script; we can do that by typing
				./fluxion.sh you can run any script this way. Once you press enter, fluxion
				will start to run. You will at first get a long list showing needed programs
				that have not been installed. You can install them using the apt get install
				 or by using the install script which does it automatically.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				When we showed a list of the files and folders in the fluxion directory, we
				can see there is a folder called “install”, navigate to that folder and use the
				list command to see the available files. You will see a script labeled
				install.sh, run in by typing ./install.sh once you click enter, the script will
				start installing the missing programs.
				It might take a while so please be patient. If you are asked a question during
				installation, you can reply by typing y for yes and n for no.
				Once the installation is done, you can type cd .. to go back by one directory
				to the fluxion folder. We can now run the fluxion script, but first, let us talk
				about wireless cards.
				In order for fluxion or any other wireless hacking tools to work, your
				computer’s wireless card must support monitor mode. This allows your
				wireless card to intercept packets or data from the network even if that data
				was not being sent to your computer. You can look up if your wireless card
				supports monitor mode by searching it online. If your card does not support
				monitor mode, you can buy ones that do on places like Amazon, they can
				be plugged in using via USB and some cost as low as $20.
				My computer’s internal wireless card does not support monitor mode so I
				will also connect an external wireless card via USB. Once the wireless card
				is placed in a USB port, you will have to go to the Devices menu on the top
				bar of the Kali Linux virtual machine window. Navigate to where it is
				written USB and select your wireless card in order to use it in Kali Linux.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Now we have to fire up fluxion by using the fluxion.sh script. When it starts
				to run, it will detect the wireless card and switch to monitor mode
				automatically.
				The first thing you will be asked is to choose the language you want to use.
				You can select a language by typing the language’s number on the list. I
				want to use Fluxion in English so I chose 1.
				After that, you will be asked to select the channel to scan. Let us scan all
				the channels so we will select the option 1 and press enter.
				Fluxion will run a scan of all available Wi-Fi networks and show them on a
				white window. I have a test Wi-Fi labeled test which can be seen in the
				image that follows. You can also see on the bottom that a device is
				connected to it. The BSSID is the MAC Address of the router and the
				ESSID is its name.
				You can stop the scanning by clicking on the window and pressing Ctrl + C.
				You will be shown a fluxion window with all the detected networks.
				Networks that are red in color are those with connected devices. Select the
				Wi-Fi network you want to attack by entering the number of the network. In
				my device, the test network is number 2.
				When you press enter you will be asked for a handshake which we don’t
				have, so we will press enter to skip that part. A handshake is used by a
				router to communicate with an already connected user. This allows a user
				who has connected once to connect to the Wi-Fi network another time
				without having to reenter the password
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				If a hacker can capture the handshake, he can try to crack it in order to get
				the password of the Wi-Fi network. This is usually time-consuming.
				After skipping the handshake part since we don’t have it, we will be asked
				to select a method to capture the handshake. You can use any option you
				want here but the pyrit option is the best one. So I’ll select 1.
				Two windows will pop up. All you need to do is patiently wait until the top
				window shows a message that the WPA handshake has been captured. It
				may take between 30 seconds to 5 minutes. You can try to speed things up
				by closing the bottom window after one or two minutes.
				After the handshake is captured, you will have to also close this window.
				Now you will have to check the handshake. You can do this by selecting the
				handshake by typing 1.
				If the handshake is not corrupter you will be asked to either select an SSL
				certificate or create one. We will choose the option to create an SSL
				certificate (option 1). The next option is to choose an attack option which
				will be the Web Interface option (option 1). The SSL certificate will be used
				on the web interface to make it look secure and trustworthy.
				Our final option will be to choose the template for our web interface. Since
				most people around here use Huawei routers, which is what I will select as
				my interface (option 28).
				Four new windows will appear which execute the attack. The user will be
				disconnected from the original Wi-Fi network called TEST, he will have no
				choice but to reconnect but he will unknowingly connect to fake Wi-Fi
				network that is similar to the original. He will then be asked via a web
				interface similar to that of Huawei (or whatever interface you chose) to
				enter the Wi-Fi password.
				Once the password is entered, fluxion will confirm if it is the correct
				password and then display it on the screen. The password I used is 123Test,
				which is what can be seen here.
				There are many other scripts and programs that can be used for wireless
				attacks. These scripts can be accessed by heading to the Applications bar on
				the top left corner of the Kali Linux desktop.
				Now that you have acquired the password, you can use it to connect to the
				network.

				Chapter 4 The Hacking Guide
			</h2>
			<p>
				Whatever is explained or taught in this section is to be used for
				developmental, educational and research purposes only. We will consider
				hacking into Android devices, but before then we need to ask some
				questions. Why are we hacking into an Android device? For what purpose?
				A vast number of people possess Android devices.  
				Similar to software development, hacking is difficult and you can’t become
				a professional hacker overnight. Hacking requires great skill and a level of
				reasoning. As a hacker, your brain must function like a processing unit. To
				practice hacking on a small platform, you will need to have some
				experience with one of the various programming languages. Knowledge of
				programming languages like C++, Linux and FORTRAN is very useful
				when it comes to hacking. However, you will also need other kinds of
				knowledge to become a skillful hacker. Daily, by reason of upgrades in
				security measures, hacking becomes tougher. As a hacker, you must learn to
				understand and beat security challenges.

				If you are a pro at penetrating servers and breaking into networks, the
				easiest way to go about your business is by harnessing the power of Kali
				Linux 2.0. Kali Linux 2.0 is by far the best Linux distribution that makes
				hacking very easy for the programmer. You will be able to achieve your
				goals in little time and become the owner of your personal network.  
				1. Metasploit
				Metasploit is a frame that helps to create exploits, shellcodes, triggers,
				honey pots and payloads. Metasploit is a bank of several exploits and
				similar elements that are packed into its frame. The software is public and
				can be used on many operating systems out there, including Linux and
				Windows. It comes with Kali Linux by default. Metasploit is a foul device
				that can threaten other networks. You want to examine faults in network
				security and learn how to manage them to prevent external attacks. 
				Web applications and servers are also subject to attacks by Metasploit. In
				Metasploit, GUI and command line interfaces exist equally. Metasploit is
				available as a free version and but also has paid version (Metasploit Pro),
				which offers more functionality
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				NMAP is short for “network mapper.” It probes a network while searching
				for ports that are accessible to map network servers and so on. The core
				function of NMAP is security analysis and the examination of networks to
				detect computers that are available online. NMAP uses IP addresses and
				packets in a way that reveals useful details about a network. For example, it
				shows the ports that can be used to access the network and the apps being
				used on the computer. It is advisable to first have some idea concerning the
				commands before proceeding further to the GUI. 
				3. Armitage
				The Armitage is a display control tool employed in cyber security that
				creates an interface for the Metasploit attachment that simplifies Metasploit,
				making it less complex so it can easily be comprehended. Armitage is a
				good place to start if you want to learn more about Metasploit. All of the
				functions of Metasploit are gathered by Armitage in the procedures of
				hacking, as they are meant to exploit, circumvent and raid a network.

			<p>
				JTC is the acronym for “Jhon the Ripper.” It is a renowned tool for breaking
				through an arena that is heavily secured with passwords. Simply referred to
				as Jhon in the hacking world, it is the primary tool used to launch what is
				called a dictionary intrusion. Jhon the Ripper has a bank of text called the
				“word list”, which is composed of previously cracked passwords. Jhon the
				Ripper selects one of these passwords from its bank and replaces the
				wordlist of the password to be cracked. Then it gives the result of the new
				imputed password. In other words, the hacker takes a previously cracked
				password and interferes with the system in such a way that this previously
				cracked password is substituted for the password to be cracked. After that,
				the past success is re-initiated by Jhon and the substituted password is recracked. There is a similarity between Jhon the Ripper and THC Hydra,
				which is a similar cracking tool. The slight difference is that Jhon is used
				offline while Hydra is used an online.

				Wireshark is an open source tool that scrutinizes networks with an outline
				of network traffic. This tool belongs to the category of network sniffers.  
				Ethereal was Wireshark’s old name. Its core function is to keep an eye on
				differences that are used to monitor network traffic and to investigate
				packets that are sent to and fro. After all of this, the results are presented to
				the user in a format that can be understood. As time has passed, there have
				been noticeable advancements. For example, filters and other various
				packets like color coding have been created. All of this development has
				helped in one way or another, especially in sharpening the penetrating
				power of the testers. These testers are able to penetrate further into
				networks and thoroughly scrutinize the packets. 
				If you really want to become a master in network analysis, network
				penetration and acquire other hacking skills, you must have experience and
				knowledge about Wireshark.  
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Hydra, very identical to Jhon, is a password-dismantling device. In the
				hands of expert hackers, Hydra can be dangerous. It is mostly combined
				with Jhon, as both are used simultaneously. Hydra breaks passwords by
				combining the power of a dictionary and brute force to assault a password
				where it is to be imputed. Hydra gives permission to a large scope of
				protocols. Examples include SSH, POP3, IMAP, Database, SMB, VNC,
				LDAP, SMB, RTPS, HTTP, POP, TCP, SMTP and RTPS. 
				The most powerful tool that currently exists online is “Suite.” Suite is an
				app that provides web services and penetration testing. When it is fully
				maximized, the possibility of its usage is almost limitless. Below are some
				of the features of the Burp Suite. 
				Intercepting Proxy is a feature that monitors and improves communication
				between an application and the web browser.  
				Spider is a feature that specifies all lists, names and characteristics of files
				that exist on a network. 
				Web Scanner is an important feature that scans for loopholes in the server. 
				Intruder is a feature that can be used to launch attacks against networks. It
				is used to scan for flaws and take advantage of them. 
				Repeater improves and makes solicitations on behalf of the user. 
				Sequencer examines the irregularity of the token’s CSRF, authenticity
				token, etc. 
				Extensions allow the user to include his or her own customized plugin or to
				install plugins directly from the systems database. They are used to
				creatively stage a tactical and cryptic attack.

			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				One characteristic of the OSWAP Zed Attack Proxy (acronym: ZAP) is that
				it has no price tag attached to it. Its open source is made available to the
				public. OSWAP is a popular feature and an effective proxy tool that can
				substitute the Burp Suite. OSWAP is user friendly and does its job
				efficiently and effectively because it exposes the flaws of web apps. The
				functions of OSWAP are summarized as follows: 
				A. Manual testing
				B. Scrutinizing networks for leakages  
				C. Scrutinizing the user target 
				8. Engineering Toolkit
				The Social-Engineering Toolkit, or SET as it is called, is another important
				thing to mention. With this tool, assaults are launched against the user who
				is operating the system instead of the system itself. It has some special
				attributes that grant access to Java applets. The user is not aware of these
				applets because the SET ensures everything is done underground. This
				command line, when maximized, can produce effective results. It works on
				any basic operating system including Linux and Windows. 
				9. Aircrack-ng
				This is another kit that dissembles passwords and allows users to access the
				internet. In the right hands, it can be a profitable tool. However, it is
				difficult and requires a lot of effort. For newbies, Aircrack-ng is a
				shortwave cracking program. It is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys
				cracking kit that can reclaim keys from various kinds of data. However, the
				data must have adequate packets and be trapped (in monitor mode).
				Aircrack-ng is an indispensable tool that you definitely want to be using.  
				Novices should be able crack a secured WEP with the right tools. However,
				a lot of effort will be required to crack a WPA/WPA2.

				Chapter 5 Mobile Hacking
			</h2>
			<p>
				With the dramatic increase in the usage of mobile phones, especially smart
				phones, mobile hacking is gaining popularity. Mobiles can be hacked to
				extract information about the device, to steal personal information, to make
				calls or even to corrupt the device, making it unusable.
				Mobile phones with Bluetooth can also be hacked using popular software
				tools such as Super Bluetooth Hack, Blue Scanner, Bluesnarfer, Blue sniff,
				btCrawler, etc. Their features are described below:
				Super bluetooth hack
				This is a popular mobile hacking tool that scans and discovers the nearest
				mobile devices and connects with them. After connecting, one can gain
				access to the victim’s phone book or SMS and can even switch the target
				device on or off. If the target device has weak security, this tool can also
				allow the hacker to send an SMS or make calls through the target device.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Blue Scanner is a software tool that discovers all the nearest mobile devices
				that have Bluetooth turned on and will attempt to obtain information about
				each of those devices without having to pair with them.
				Bluesnarfer
				Bluesnarfer is a hacking tool that can connect to a Bluetooth device and
				steal information from it. Such stealing of information using a Bluetooth
				connection is called Bluesnarfing. Bluesnarfer can provide the hacker with
				access to the victim’s text messages, calendar, contacts, emails, and
				sometimes pictures and videos. It can all be done without the knowledge of
				the victim and without having to pair with the victim’s mobile phone. Using
				this tool, the hacker can send malicious code that can corrupt or completely
				shut down the target device.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Blue sniff is not a hacking tool in itself, but it can discover the nearest
				Bluetooth devices that are in the “hidden” mode. Bluetooth devices that
				are in the hidden mode cannot be discovered during the usual Bluetooth
				scans. Blue Sniff, a Linux utility, can do the job with ease.
				Hacking into Mobile Apps
				Smartphones are popular because of the wide variety of apps that can be
				installed on them. Mobile apps can be hacked. When an app is accessed
				from an app store, its binary code is downloaded to be read and executed by
				the device’s processor. But these binaries have vulnerabilities that can be
				exploited by a technically well-equipped hacker. Such exploits can be
				categorized into two types, namely:
				Modification/injection of code
				Reverse engineering
				Modification/Injection of the code
				This is done by inserting malicious code in the app’s binaries. The main
				motivation for a hacker to perform code modifications in the binaries of an
				app is to change the behavior of the app. In general, the binary code
				modifications are done to:
				modify the app’s license agreement
				compromise its security features
				perform unauthorized transactions from the app
				unlock the full version, if the app is a trial version
				bypass its purchase requirements
				disable the display of ads.
				After making the modifications, the hacker can distribute it as a software
				patch or a crack. Such software patches can be downloaded to bypass
				several of the app’s restrictions. The app with the modified code can also be
				repackaged as a new app and distributed.
				Reverse Engineering
				In reverse engineering, the binary code is first analyzed using code analysis
				tools. Based on the analysis report, the hacker can reverse-engineer the app
				binaries to steal the source code and other sensitive information. The code
				and data stolen can be reused to build a similar app with a different brand
				name and it is then submitted to the app stores.
				The tasks that can be performed by a hacker using the techniques of code
				modification and reverse engineering can be illustrated in the above
				diagram.

			<h2>
				Chapter 6 Penetration Testing Basics
			</h2>
			<p>
				What is a Penetration Testing?
				Penetration testing, in its simplest form, is a type of computer security
				testing that figures out how secure a computer system is. Usually, the test is
				done to find the vulnerability and various risks that might be present in a
				given computer system or application.  If a computer is not sufficiently
				secure then hackers and other forms of attack will easily access the system
				and compromise any data stored on it.
				Many different computer security experts describe, conduct and market
				penetration testing differently. This makes it be confused with other
				computer security processes such as security assessment, vulnerability
				scanning, and compliance audit. Penetration testing is different from all
				these other processes in a number of critical ways:
				Unlike vulnerability scanning, penetration testing does not just uncover
				vulnerabilities; it also explores all the uncovered vulnerabilities so as to
				prove the real world attack vectors a computer system faces. 
				Although penetration testing may employ automated tools and processes, its
				main focus is on the human skills and sound judgment of the team of
				individuals that conduct the testing. This is because security threats can beat
				the most advanced and sophisticated tools and technologies but it cannot
				escape a human mind which can always think outside the box. 
				Security and compliance audit search for the presence of security measures
				and configuration but penetration testing goes a step further to establish
				how effective those security measures and configurations are against realworld attacks. 
				Penetration testing explores multiple attack vectors against a given target so
				as to come up with a stronger security combination that is effective in
				protecting a computer system. 
				Why do you need Penetration Testing?
				Penetration testing is quite valuable to computer users, especially in large
				organizations that have many computers and use computers to process
				valuable information such as an employee’s payroll and their personal
				details.  The following are important reasons why businesses invest in
				penetration testing
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Simulates an attack environment
				The only way you can be able to protect your computer from an attack is if
				you know exactly how an intruder will access your computer.  Penetration
				testing helps you know this as it helps simulate attack environment using
				various attack vectors and thus gives an idea of how best to increase your
				computer’s security. 
				❖     Help uncover security loopholes in your computer security
				system
				Most of the major computer attacks that go unnoticed exploit loopholes in
				the computers security system. Penetration testing examines your computer
				software and features so as to identify security weak points where an
				intruder can gain access through. This is important information that is then
				used to beef up the computer security for a given system.
				❖     Helps find ways to beat Black Hat attacks
				Black hat attacks keep changing and adapting to existing computer security
				measures. This means that to effectively secure your computer, you need to
				find ways you can defeat black hat attacks. Using penetration testing you
				can simulate how black hat hackers will get into your system and this will
				help you know how best to build your computer security so that it can keep
				black hat attacks at bay. 
				❖     Estimates the magnitude of potential attacks on businesses
				Different kinds of attack cause various levels of losses. In addition, some
				kinds of attacks are more common in certain fields than others. To protect
				your business, financial records and customers from potential attacks it is
				important that you know the magnitude of various attacks within your
				business line. This will help provide evidence of why you need to invest in
				various types of computer security technologies. 
				❖      Helps Enhance your Management System:
				Computer security is an important component of information management.
				This means that if you are using computers for your business then computer
				security is an integral part of your management system. Penetration testing
				provides you with important information on computer security threats and
				degrees of vulnerability from various vectors of attack. This helps
				reorganize how you manage your business so as to efficiently secure your
				computer systems and your business information. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Protects you from financial losses
				A simple security breach can result in huge losses for any business.
				Criminals can use computer vulnerability to conduct fraud activities that
				will result in huge losses. In addition, they may steal your customers’ data
				and share it online which may result in loss of business and even legal cases
				that may further hamper your financial wellbeing.
				❖      Identify undetectable vulnerability
				Today with the advancement in technology there are a lot of vulnerabilities
				that are difficult to detect. You need information on such vulnerability so as
				to effectively protect your computer systems. Using penetration testing you
				can know areas and types of attack that will be difficult to detect and come
				up with measures to deal with them when they happen. 
				❖     Test the ability of your security system to foil an attack
				How effective are your computer security measures?  The only way you can
				be able to know this is by penetration testing. Penetration testing will help
				you know how easy an attacker can access your computer and thus be able
				to respond effectively.
				It is now clear that there are many reasons why you need to conduct
				penetration testing.  Defining the nature and scope of your penetration
				testing will largely depend on your goals.  If you are worried about attacks
				on your business, then you will consider a more intense and aggressive
				penetration testing than when your main goal is to pass compliance
				assessment. 
				So what is the right penetration testing for you?  If penetration testing is a
				requirement in your industry, then you may be tempted to find the cheapest
				penetration testing service that you can find. But this is not always the right
				way to approach this issue. Consider these two factors:
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				1. Do you have a budget for penetration testing?
				If you already have a budget for penetration testing, then there is no need
				for cutting corners, instead, leverage the budget to get value for your money
				by widening the nature and scope of your penetration testing. 
				2. What will be the effect of an attack?
				Before you decide on the scope of your penetration testing it is important to
				find out what will be the impact of an attack. For example, if an attack is
				likely to result in loss of money, business and legal proceedings against
				you, then you will consider having an investment in intense penetration
				testing. 
				What to consider when Hiring a Penetration Testing Service Provider
				To do penetration testing, you need an expert with the right experiences,
				skills, and tools to do the job. However, there are a lot of people out there
				providing the service, with some not well qualified for the job. It is thus
				important that you pick the right team to do the job for you.  The following
				are important suggestions that you should consider when hiring someone to
				do a penetration testing for you: 
				❖      Look for the right qualification  
				Qualification is the key in getting the right penetration tester. Before even
				considering the qualification for the team it is important you make sure that
				they are not connected to the management of the computer system to be
				tested. This is important to eliminate bias in their job. For example, if you
				have a third party manage your computer system, you should not again hire
				them to do penetration testing, because even if they are qualified for the job
				they are bound to be biased.
				To know if someone has the right skills to do penetration testing you need
				to find out the kind of certification they hold.  Some of the certifications
				that are a testimony to the competence and skills of a penetration tester
				include: Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), GIAC Web Application
				Penetration Tester GWAPT), Offensive Security Certified Professional
				(OSCP), Advance Penetration Tester (GXPN), CREST Penetration Testing
				Certifications and GIAC Certified Penetration Tester (GPEN) among
				others.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				You should also be keen on past experiences as someone with vast
				experience in the field will provide you with better services than someone
				new.  For example, you should be interested in knowing the years of
				experience they have doing penetration testing, the type of companies they
				have worked for, the kind of projects they have worked on and the
				references to attest to what the provider is putting forward.  This is
				important because a provider that is relatively new in the field but has
				worked predominantly on projects within your field may be a better bet
				than a provider with vast experiences in other fields and very little in your
				very own field. 
				Before you hire a tester it is important that you also get a tester with the
				right tools for the job. By interrogating the candidates for the job ensure
				that you get a proper background check as this will help you know if they
				have the right experience, skills, and tools to do the job to your satisfaction.
				This is the only way you will get the most qualified provider to do your
				penetration testing. 
				❖      Know the nature and scope of your penetration testing
				If you know what you want to be done that you are more likely to get the
				right person to do the job, but if you don’t know what you want than anyone
				else is qualified for the job. The right team will help you define the scope of
				your penetration test as well as its nature. So before you give the most
				qualified team the job you need to sit down as look at the nature of the work
				to be done. If your provider doesn’t seem to get what you want to be done,
				then he/she is not the right candidate for the job. Give higher priority to
				individuals who want to limit the scope of your testing to key areas with the
				highest number of vulnerability and attacks. This is important as it will help
				the process to focus on key areas of your computer security. 
				❖     Black box or White Box Penetration testing
				These two kinds of penetration are important in determining how well you
				conduct your penetration testing process. Each has its own benefits over the
				other. For example, a white hat penetration testing in which case the tester
				has prior information on the system or network access is less time
				consuming and cost less leaving you with enough time and money to beef
				up your computer security and it also help highlight the kind of threats
				insiders can cause to a computer system thus making it easy to protect your
				computer system from such threats.  Black box penetration testing, on the
				other hand, does not allow the tester the luxury of having an insider’s
				knowledge and thus provides the best test result for the system from the
				perspective of a real world attacker. In addition, because the attacker spends
				so much time, the black box penetration testing may provide a lot of
				information on other vulnerabilities within the system. 
				Before you hire a penetration tester, it is important that you know the kind
				of penetration testing and you only hire someone who is an expert or feels
				comfortable with that particular penetration testing. for example, if you a
				provider tells you that they are only comfortable with white hat testing and
				you want a black box testing, then consider finding someone else who is
				comfortable as a black box tester.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				❖      Goals and Objectives
				Your goals and objectives should be able to guide you to pick the right
				penetration tester. What do you want to achieve with your penetration
				testing? Does the experience of the penetration tester you are considering
				match those goals? Some penetration testers may have experience and the
				right qualifications, but their experience does not show that they can
				achieve your goals and objectives. So before you start looking to hire
				someone to do a penetration testing for you ensure that you have set the
				goals and objectives for the process. This will not only help you get the
				right talent for the job, but will also help you set your scope and measure
				the outcome of the process. 
				When do you have to Perform Penetration Testing?
				Penetration testing should be done regularly so as to secure your computer
				systems and protect your data and information from the ever advancing
				attacks. In addition to conducting penetration testing regularly you should
				ensure that you conduct penetration testing whenever:
				✓    You discover new threats to your computer systems
				✓    You add a new hardware/network or infrastructure to your
				computer system 
				✓    You install new software or update your system software
				✓    You move offices or add office space
				✓    You create a new end-user policy or program

			<h2>
				Chapter 7 Spoofing Techniques
			</h2>
			<p>
				A system can be hacked either locally or through the Internet using one of
				the following methods:
				Using a pen drive or an external hard disk to infect the
				system with a virus
				Faking user identity to gain access rights to a system
				Misusing the trust between the network system and the
				user
				Now, how do hackers manage to access or attack a system amidst all the
				security protocols and strong passwords protecting it? How can a hacker
				break into a network in spite of strict rules that only certain authorized
				persons can access the network? Most of the time, the answer is spoofing.
				The different types of spoofing are as follows:
				IP spoofing
				ARP spoofing
				DNS server spoofing
				Website spoofing
				Email spoofing
				Ip spoofing
				Networks do not allow access to all their IP addresses. Only certain trusted
				IP addresses can make their way into the network. To gain access into the
				network, the hacker uses an IP address that spoofs a trusted IP address.
				For example, let us suppose that a certain network allows the IP address
				x.x.x.x to gain access into its system. A hacker whose system IP address is
				y.y.y.y spoofs their IP address to appear like x.x.x.x to gain access into the
				network.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				IP spoofing is mostly performed to flood the target system with huge
				amounts of data, increasing the traffic. Sending more data packets than the
				system can handle will overload the target system. All the data packets
				seem to come from several spoofed IP addresses. In another method, the
				target system’s IP address can be spoofed to send a huge number of data
				packets to the other systems on the same network. To the other systems, it
				appears as though the data packets are being sent from the target system,
				when in reality it is actually the hacker who is sending the packets from
				their system. As a result, all the systems that have received the data packets
				flood the target system with responses, thereby overloading it with traffic.
				Some networks use IP-based authentication instead of the user login
				authentication. In such authentication schemes, the IP addresses of the
				machines that are requesting access are verified based on trust relationships.
				In such cases, the hacker can perform spoofing by impersonating a trusted
				machine, which has permission to access the network.
				Arp spoofing
				Address resolution protocol (ARP) is a protocol that maps the IP address of
				a machine to the MAC address. MAC stands for media access control. The
				MAC address of a system is nothing but the physical address of the
				hardware. ARP spoofing involves a hacker spoofing ARP messages and
				sending them across the network, such that the MAC address of the
				hacker’s system gets linked an authorized system’s IP address, which is
				present on a network. Thus, all the data to be sent to the authorized system
				will actually be sent to the hacker’s system.
				ARP spoofing is performed for the following reasons:
				Stealing information that is private to the network
				Modifying data in transmission
				Halting the traffic in the network
				Hijacking sessions
				Implementing man-in-the-middle attacks
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				It is possible to carry out ARP spoofing only in local area networks
				(LANs). This is because the address resolution protocol can only be used in
				a local area network.
				DNS Server Spoofing
				The domain name system is a service that maps the domain names to their
				IP addresses. The DNS server allows email addresses, uniform resource
				locators (URLs) and domain names to be resolved into their respective IP
				addresses. A domain name spoofing attack involves an attacker
				manipulating a DNS server so that a particular domain name is mapped to
				an IP address that is under control of the attacker. Those IP addresses
				contain malware-infected files. This type of spoofing is commonly used to
				propagate computer viruses and worms over the Internet.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Website spoofing
				Website spoofing involves the creation of a fake website that impersonates
				a legitimate website. Usually, it has the same design as that of the original
				website and sometimes may possess a similar URL. So, when an individual
				mistakes the spoof website to be the original one and enters sensitive
				information like username/password or other personal details like phone
				number, Social Security Number or address, the information actually goes
				into the hands of the attacker.
				In a more serious attack, the attacker may create a shadow copy of the
				WWW (World Wide Web) so that the victim’s data traffic is turned toward
				the attacker’s system. As a result, the attacker can capture private
				information on the victim. The URL of the spoof website can be made to
				look genuine by using control characters. The actual address of the website
				remains concealed in the background.
				For example, let us suppose you are a bank customer and you use the bank’s
				website for online banking. Let us suppose you have been redirected to a
				fake website that has the same design and layout of the original bank
				website. It may also possess a URL that is similar to the bank website’s
				URL. Hence, you mistake the fake site for the actual site and enter sensitive
				information like your credit card details and the PIN number. Now the
				attacker running the fake website captures the information you have entered
				and may use it for malicious purposes.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Email spoofing involves forging the “from address” of an email before
				sending it to make it look like the email has arrived from a trusted
				person/source. Spammers, to deceive the receiver about the legitimacy of
				the email origin, mostly use email spoofing. Email spoofing is also used to
				circulate worms or viruses through emails.
				For example, let us suppose that an individual “X” receives an infected
				email, which they open unknowingly. The worm code sent with the email
				infects X’s email account. The worm code then goes through X’s email
				contacts and detects the email addresses of two individuals “Y” and “Z.”
				Let us suppose X, Y and Z are friends.
				Without X’s knowledge, the worm code composes a similarly infected
				email and sends it to Y. It is not a big problem, if Y receives the email from
				an unknown source, as they are unlikely to open it. But what actually
				happens is, the worm code uses Z’s email address to forge the “from
				address” before sending the email to Y. In Y’s inbox, the infected email
				appears to have come from “Z,” who is a friend of Y. But, in reality it is a
				mail circulated by a worm code. Y is likely to open the infected email as it
				shows Z���s email address as the “from address.”

			<h2>
				Chapter 8 Some Of The Basic Functions Of Linux

			</h2>
			<p>
				Now it’s time to move on to some of the basics that you are going to need to
				learn in order to use Linux confidently. These functions are important for
				helping you to navigate the computer system with ease. Let’s take a bit of
				time now to look at these basic functions, and learn how they can work for
				us. 
				Logging In and Out of the Interface
				When it comes to the Linux operating system, you are first going to need to
				provide your login credentials, meaning a username and password, each
				time that you try to get onto the system. In addition to this, there are two
				modes that you can choose between when you are running the Linux
				system, and we will take a look at them below:
				Graphical Mode
				The graphical mode is going to be the default mode for your desktop
				computer. Basically, if the computer screen is asking for the password and
				username before letting you on, you will know that you are using the
				graphical mode. To sign in, you will just need to enter in the login
				credentials that you have already set up, and then hit OK or ENTER to
				continue. 
				After you enter in this login information, it can sometimes take a few
				minutes to get everything loaded up and ready to go; the amount of time
				that it takes for things to get going will depend on how powerful your
				computer is and its processing capabilities. When the computer has finished
				loading, you will need to open up an‘xterm’, otherwise known as a terminal
				window. You will be able to find this tool by simply clicking on
				Applications and then choosing Utilities. Note: in some of the newer
				versions of Linux, there will be an icon available to speed up this process
				and you can just click on that rather than going through the steps above. 
				The terminal window is basically going to be the control panel for your
				operating system. Most of the procedures that you want to do with the
				operating system can be done with this tool, and as a general rule, when you
				open the terminal window it should display some kind of command prompt.
				Usually this is going to start out with your username for the system, as well
				as some information about updates that were performed. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				When you are ready to log out with this mode, you need to make sure that
				you have closed out of the terminal windows and all of the open programs.
				You can then find the icon for logging out,or search for the Log Out option
				on your main menu. If you forget to close out of an application or a
				window, it isn’t that big of a deal since the computer can do it for you, but
				the system is going to try and retrieve all of these windows and programs
				the next time you come back, and this can slow down the process of getting
				your computer started. Once you see that the screen is once again asking for
				your log in credentials, you will then know that you are all logged out of the
				system. 
				Text Mode
				The other mode that you can use for your credentials on this system is the
				text mode. You will be able to see that you are in text mode when the whole
				screen is black with just a few characters on it. This mode’s screen is going
				to show a bit of data, including the name of the computer, a bit of data
				about that computer, and then a prompt that is usable for signing in. This
				one is going to be a bit different compared to the graphical mode because
				you will need to press the ENTER key once you are done typing in the
				username, as there is not going to be a clickable button or link on the
				screen. You can then type in the password and hit ENTER once again. 
				A nice thing about this mode is that while you are typing in the username
				and password, you will not see any signs that you are typing. You wont see
				the words, letters, or even dots and special characters come up while you
				are typing. This can be confusing to some people who are brand new to
				using this system, but it operates this way for security purposes. 
				Once the system accepts your username and password, you will receive the
				message of the day. Some of the distributions of Linux will have a feature
				that is known as the fortune cookie feature, and that is going to provide you
				with some extra thoughts each day. Then, the system will move on to
				providing you with a shell, explained with the same details that you will get
				when using the graphical mode. 
				When you are ready to log out from this system, you will simplyneed to
				type in‘logout’ and then press ENTER. You will be able to tell that you are
				logged out from the system successfully when the screen comes back up
				and asks you for your login credentials again. 
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
				The Basic Commands
Now that understand how to log in and out of the Linux system based on
the type of mode we are in, it is time to start working on some of the basic
commands that we will be using. These are pretty simple to learn, and if
you have worked with some programming languages in the past, you may
have seen some of these commands before. Some of the commands that you
should learn as a beginner include:
Is - this is going to show a set of files that are in the
directory that you are using at this point in time. 
Passwd - this command is going to change the password
of the user who is currently on the system. 
Pwd - this is going to show the current working
directory. 
Cd directory - this is going to change the directories.
Man command - this is going to read man pages on
command. 
Exit or log out - this is going to make it easier to leave the
current session. 
Info command - this is going to read info pages on
command. 
File‘filename’- this is going to show the file type of the
file that is given a certain name. 
Apropos string - this one will search for strings using
the‘what is’ database. 
Other Things to Note
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
				In most cases, you are going to issue the commands by themselves. For
				example, you can just type in “is” and the system will be able to do the rest
				of the work for you. A command is going to behave in a different manner if
				you specify an option, and you can do this by introducing a dash. When
				working in GNU, it will accept some longer options, as long as you
				introduce them with two dashes, but there are some commands that won’t
				have these extra options. 
				What is known as an ‘argument’ to a command, is a specification for the
				object on which you want to apply the command. A good example of this is
				Is / etc. for this example, the /etc would be the directory and the argument,
				while Is would be the command. This particular argument is going to show
				that you would like to see the contents of the /etc directory rather than the
				default directory. You will then be able to click on the ENTER key, and go
				to that directory. Depending on what you are trying to do, some of your
				commands will need arguments to help the system make sense of what you
				are looking for. 
				Using the Bash Features
				The Bash, which is the default GNU shell on most of the Linux systems that
				you will use, is going to make it easier to use certain combinations of keys
				in order to perform a task easily and quickly. Some of the most common
				features to use with the Bash shell include:
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Tab – this is going to complete the command or the
				filename. If there is more than one option, the system will use
				a visual or audio notification to tell you. If the system detects
				that there are a lot of possibilities, it will ask you whether you
				would like to check all of them. 
				Tab Tab – this one is going to show the completion
				possibilities for a filename or command. 
				Ctrl + A – this one is going to move the cursor over to the
				start of the current command line. 
				Ctrl + C – this one is going to end your computer
				program, and then will show the Linux prompt. 
				Ctrl + D – this one is going to log you out of your current
				session. This is a key combination that is similar to typing exit
				or logout. 
				Ctrl + E – this is going to move the cursor to the end of
				your current command line. 
				Ctrl + H –this is going to work similar to pressing the
				backspace key on the keyboard. 
				Ctrl + L – this one is going to clear out the current
				terminal. 
				Ctrl + R – this is going to search through the history of
				commands
				Ctrl + Z – this is going to allow you to suspend your
				computer programs. 
				Arrow right / arrow left – these keys are going to make it
				easier to move the cursor along the command line that you are
				currently on. You may find it useful if you need to add in
				more characters or make some changes in the program. 
				Arrow up / arrow down –these are the keys that will make
				it easier to browse the history of the system. You can access
				any lines that you want to repeat, change some of the data
				when needed, and then press ENTER to execute these new
				commands quickly. 
				Shift + Page Up/ Shift + Page Down – using these key
				combinations will allow you to check the terminal buffer. 
				As you get a bit more familiar with the Linux system, you will begin to
				better understand how these commands work, as well as some learn other
				commands, which will make it easier to use the Linux system. These are
				just a few of the initial commands that you should learn how to use, because
				they are going to make navigating through the system much easier for you.
				Give them a try and practice logging in and out of your system, so that you
				can get a feel for how it works before moving on. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				The next thing that we are going to work on is the files and the directories
				that are found inside of the Linux system. Many new users are going to
				have issues with this operating system because they simply don’t know
				what information is stored, or even where the information is placed. This
				chapter aims to answer these questions, making your experience with using
				Linux that much easier. 
				The different types of files
				For the most part, you are going to be working on regular files. These are
				files that will hold onto ordinary data such as outputs from a task, text files,
				and programs. Linux is not the same as Windows in the way it operates, so
				keep that in mind. The files on screen are going to look similar to what you
				are used to with Windows, but the places they are stored and how they work
				will be a bit different with the Linux system. 
				Basically, the file system is going to start at the root, which is also known as
				the simple path; this is the place where everything is going to start from and
				where everything is going to go when done. Aside from having the root and
				the ports that go off it, things are going to look quite similar to what you are
				used to on other operating systems, but you may notice that they are cleaner
				and easier to handle now. The file extensions are still there in order to help
				the user, which may make them a bit harder right in the beginning, but over
				time you will start to appreciate the file extensions because they make it
				easier to find your files and information as needed. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				The layout of your file system
				To make things easier to find and understand, you will see that the file
				system on Linux is going to be similar to a tree. The structure is going to
				change and grow as you add in more files or you remove them over time.
				Overall though, they are all going to come out from the root, and then the
				changes that you make will show up after, further up the tree. You can add
				in as many files as you need to make the system work well, and you will see
				the tree changing form over time accordingly. Keep in mind that the names
				on the file trees are not always required, but they are used for convention
				and to keep things easy to navigate.
				The tree for the file system is going to begin at the slash, which is also
				known as the root directory. This is going to be shown with a (/). The root
				directory will contain all of the underlying files as well as the directories
				that are shown inside the operating system. The slash is often going to
				proceed the directories that are just one spot below the root directory. This
				is basically going to indicate the position of these directories, and can help
				to differentiate them from other locations on the computer that may have a
				similar name. Any time that you are using a newer version of Linux, make
				sure to check out the root directory first to find the file that you want. 
				The subdirectories of a root directory
				There are going to be a variety of subdirectories that come after your root
				directory in order to make up the system tree within your operating system.
				Some of the subdirectories that you may find helpful include:
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				/bin–this one is going to contain your ordinary programs
				including the ones that are shared by the system administrator,
				the system, and by users. 
				/dev–this one is going to hold the references to all the
				peripheral hardware on the CPU. In general, these are going
				to be shown on files that have special characteristics. 
				/boot–this one is going to be composed of startup files
				and a kernel. Some of the Linux systems are going to include
				the grand unified boot loader, or grub, information as well. 
				/etc–this is a subdirectory that is going to contain files
				related to the system configuration. This is pretty similar to
				the Control Panel that you will find with Windows. 
				/home–this is the main directory for most common users. 
				/misc–this is the subdirectory for any files that are
				considered miscellaneous. 
				/lib–this one is going to contain the library files for all the
				computer programs that are on the computer. 
				/opt–this location is going to hold some of the extra as
				well as 3rd party programs. 
				/root–this is the main directory that is used by the system
				administrator. 
				/proc–this is the virtual file array that will contain data
				about the resources of the system. Any time that you want to
				see some more information about this part, you will just need
				to open up a terminal window and then type in“man proc”to
				get stared. 
				/initrd–this is going to hold the data for the booting
				processes. Make sure that you never remove this one. 
				/lost+found–this is the directory that is going to contain
				the files that were saved if the system failed and had to close
				down suddenly. 
				/tmp–this is a storage unit that is temporary and it is used
				by your operating system. You should never use it for saving
				any work because when the system goes through a reboot, all
				of the documents in this folder will be cleaned out. 
				/sbin–this is going to hold the computer program that is
				used by the operating system and the system administrator. 
				/usr–this is going to contain the documentations,
				programs, and libraries for all user related computer
				programs. 
				/var–this is used to store any temporary files and
				variables that are generated by the user. These would include
				things like file downloads, log files, and mail queues. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				You will be able to find the kind of file that you are working on based on
				where it is stored in the computer. If you are unsure about where it is stored,
				take a look through these file starters and see where it may fit in the best
				based on what it is about, what the computer thinks it is in the first place,
				and so on. You can also determine where you would like to see the file be
				stored by adding one of these subdirectories to the beginning of your file. 
				While this system may seem a bit hard to understand in the beginning and
				you may be feeling like you are going to work on files and never find them
				again, the tree system for saving in Linux is actually quite a bit easier than
				what you will find with some of the other operating systems out there. If
				you are able to navigate through the Windows operating system in order to
				find your projects and your files, you will easily be able to figure out how
				the file systems work with Linux. It will just take a bit of time to learn what
				everything is called and to get used to this new system.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Chapter 9 Taking Command And Control
			</h2>
			<p>
				This chapter will introduce new sources of powerful Python scripts that you
				can repurpose to collect data via an external control system in the target
				machine and even use ready API to execute commands and install updates.
				By the end of the chapter you should be able to create a Python tool that
				you can control remotely over the internet to issue commands to the target
				and to receive captured data.
				Using Pastebin as a Command & Control channel
				We included a killswitch in the keylogger (the ~ key to terminate the script)
				but whether it is a good idea to have it on an actual surveillance program is
				for you to decide. Experienced hackers include a killswitch in the keylogger
				code as a function and not a simple keypress event so that they can even
				terminate it remotely if need be and not have the user unintentionally kill
				the logger.
				It is important that our keylogger tool be able to collect data and send it
				back to you, and to receive commands to execute remotely. This is called
				Command and Control. There are many Command and Control channels
				that you can use such as a chat system, a HTTP server, or Pastebin, the
				temporary plain text depository online. To illustrate Command and Control
				using our Python code, we will use Pastebin.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Pastebin provides a well-designed API that makes it easy to create scripts
				that communicate with their servers with efficiency. Before we can update
				out keylogger code, we first need to write the support code to conveniently
				access and use Pastebin API. We will call the script pastebin.py .
				Pastebin.py will use the requests library to send responses in XML format,
				therefore, we will also need to import Python’s XML parser as in our code
				below. The three URLs of interest that we will use in the script are also
				defined in this section.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Chapter 10 The Laboratory
			</h2>
			<p>
				The first task is to build our own laboratory.
				Don’t experiment the techniques I will teach you on contexts other than
				your laboratory: this is not the right way to become an ethical hacker!
				How can we build a protected environment where we can perform our
				simulations? The answer is straightforward: we can use a hypervisor.
				This consists in simultaneously executing multiple virtual machines and,
				therefore, more operating systems within the same physical system. A
				hypervisor makes the whole process much more convenient!
				Virtualization
				By using these programs, you will be able to run several operating systems
				at the same time inside your PC. The only limit you have is the RAM
				memory you can use.
				The procedure is not difficult, even though you will need to become more
				familiar with this tool. Basically, here is the list of steps you should take:
				Download a particular software called hypervisor.
				Collect the .iso images of the operating systems you want to
				install.
				Access the software.
				Start the virtual machine creation process.
				Create and boot this virtual machine.
				Proceed with the installation of the desired operating system.
				Use the virtual machine you have just created.
				Hypervisor
				You can choose among several versions. Some of them are free, while
				others require a subscription fee. Here are the most common ones:
				VMware Workstation (paid version, 30-days free trial).
				VMware Player (free version).
				Oracle Virtualbox (free version)
			</p>
			<h3>
				The hypervisor we will use in this book is the VMware Workstation. It is a
paid version, but we can take advantage of its 30-days free trial.
I have chosen to use this hypervisor because it is the most complete one in
terms of the variety of functions and options available for network
management.
For download it, go to this link and click on “Download ”:
https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing
/vmware_workstation_player/15_0.
If version 14 – the latest version of this software – is not working, you can
try version 12. Some older CPUs are not supported. If not active yet, you
need to enable the virtualization support from BIOS (search on Google).
At this point, if the installation is successful, this is what you should be able
to see, obviously without any virtual machine already installed.
Now you are finally ready for the next step.
Images of an operating system
In order to create your virtual machines, you need an image of the operating
system you want to install. For the lab we are building, you need the image
(.iso format) of the following operating systems:
Kali Linux -> freely downloadable from
https://www.kali.org/downloads/.
Windows 7 -> 30-days version, easy to find on the Internet.
Windows 10 -> 90-days version, easy to find on the Internet.
If you are wondering why I picked these operating systems, this is the main
reason: Kali Linux will be our attacking machine, basically the one which
we will use to start all our attacks. The other two Windows machines will
instead be our targets.
Creation of virtual machines
Now we just need to create virtual machines. To do this, go to "File -> New
virtual machine" and follow the recommended procedure.
Pay attention to the quantity of RAM you will be using. This amount
depends on the RAM available on your PC, and you should try not to
overuse it. Besides, for now just keep using the default options of your
network adapter.
Network management
Managing the network correctly is extremely important. If you do not
configure it correctly, the virtual machines will not be able to communicate
between each other and hence your laboratory will not work properly.
In VMware, we can use 4 different types of networks:
As you can see from the screenshot above, these are the types of networks
available:
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Bridged -> this type includes the creation of an IP address
				belonging to the network in which your physical PC is located. I
				will explain later what an IP address is.
				   
				For now, you just need to remember that it is a numerical
				representation that uniquely identifies a specific interface on the
				network. An example of an IP address is 192.168.1.10.
				   
				NAT -> once in this mode, your virtual machine can connect to
				the Internet, but it cannot be reached from the outside.
				   
				Host-only -> in this case, the virtual machine can only
				communicate with your physical host.
				   
				Custom -> here you can define your personal network and let
				all the virtual machines communicate inside it. This is the mode we
				will use!
				To create it, go to "Edit -> Virtual Network Editor" and create a new
				network as in the screenshot here below.
				Now you should go back to the settings of your virtual machine. You can
				choose the network adapter we have just created.
				After this step, each virtual machine will have its own IP address, which is
				automatically assigned and belongs to the 192.168.10.0/24 network.
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				Virtual machines booting
				Now you are ready to boot your virtual machines. If you have correctly
				performed all the operations described above, the machines will all be
				started up and will have the IP address previously assigned.
				For example, Kali Linux could have 192.168.10.1 as its IP address, while a
				Windows 7 machine could have an IP address of 192.168.10.2, and one
				with Windows 10 a value similar to 192.168.10.3.
				Keep in mind that these virtual machines will now only be able to talk to
				each other and cannot be connected to the Internet. If needed, we will have
				to change the network adapter and set the NAT mode.
				Installation of vmware tools
				Another operation you will need to complete is the installation of VMware
				Tools. They are nothing more than a set of features to improve the overall
				performance of your virtual machine.
				I won't bore you with the details. The procedure is very simple: you just
				need to search on Windows or on Google the keywords "installation of
				VMware tools on Kali”.
				Connectivity verification of virtual machines
				Our last effort now will be to verify that our virtual machines can talk to
				each other. The steps you will need to take are the following:
				1. Verify the validity of the IP address assigned to each virtual
				machine.
				2. Run the "PING" command on each virtual machine and verify
				that the response is positive.
				Let's see together how to do it:
				Access the KALI machine and run the "ifconfig" command
				from the terminal, verifying that the assigned IP address is
				available.
				Access the Windows 7/10 machine and on the command line
				type "ipconfig" to verify the presence of the assigned IP address.
				Note down these IP addresses.
				On the KALI machine, enter the command "ping IP address
				Windows 7/10" to verify that the response is positive and that we
				are not experiencing packet loss in the response.
				On the Windows 7/10 machine, type the command "ping IP
				address Kali" verifying that the response is positive and that no
				packets were lost in the response.
				If all the responses are positive, we can start working on the next step. The
				setup phase of our penetration testing lab is over.

			<h2>
				Chapter 11 Understanding Why You Need To Hack Your Own
			</h2>
			<p>
				Systems
				In order to catch a thief you have to put yourself in their shoes, to think like
				one and that is the baseline for ethical hacking. You must know your enemy
				otherwise you cannot possibly know how to fight back. Everything is
				against security at the moment. The number of system exploits is growing
				fast, as is the number of hackers, as well as their knowledge. The time will
				soon be upon us when no system is left untouched so it is absolutely vital
				that you learn how to protect your own systems. Don’t just think about the
				normal exploits tha we all know about either – think things much deeper
				than that. When you now how to hack, you know what the tricks are that a
				hacker will use to get at you – and that means you know how to protect
				yourself against them.
				Hacking targets systems that are vulnerable, weak and unprotected. While
				you may have a series of firewalls in place, encryption set up for all your
				data and use VPN’s – Virtual Private Networks – these are merely creating
				a false sense of security. These types of systems focus on the higher level
				exploits, the viruses and the traffic that comes in through the firewalls,
				without having any effect on how a hacker works. The ONLY way to
				protect your system from attack is to find the weaknesses they will use and
				secure them.
				Hackers and crackers expand their knowledge and their skills on an almost
				daily basis and you should be doing the same thing. You have to learn how
				to think like they do and to work the way they do if you want to protect
				your systems. You are the ethical hacker; you have to know what the
				crackers are doing and you have to know how to stop them. You have to
				know exactly what to look for and how to use what you find against them.
				Now, let me get one thing straight – you do not have to go all out and
				protect your systems from every single possible attack – you can’t. The
				only way you are going to that is to turn off your computer, unplug it and
				lock it away in a cupboard. That way, no one can touch your system, not
				even you. That is not a very good way of approaching security though and
				is not going to do any organization many favors. What is more important is
				that you put security measures in place against the well-known exploits, the
				more common known attacks
			</p>
			<h3>
				
			</h3>
			<p>
				It is virtually impossible to think about and anticipate all of the possible
				forms of attack, all the flaws that might be in your system that leaves it
				open. There is no way on earth that you can plan for all eventualities,
				especially the ones we don’t know about. What you can do is do your best
				to thwart the crackers. Test as many combinations as you can, test your
				entire system as well as the individual parts of it – that way you have a
				good chance of finding the exploits that will affect your whole system.
				Don’t go too far with the ethical hacking though. There is little point in
				beefing up your system against attacks that are highly unlikely to ever
				happen. Your real goals should be:
				To hack into your own systems in a way that is not
				destructive
				Find the vulnerabilities
				Work out how they can be exploited and what they can do
				Patch them and make your system more secure
				Chapter 12 Linux Commands
				But, first, let me show you some basic Linux commands that will be useful
				to us later.
				BASIC COMMANDS
				These are the most common commands that you will probably use for your
				routine tasks.
				Command to execute: ls
				Explanation: this command allows you to list the contents of files and/or
				folders.
				Command to execute: pwd
